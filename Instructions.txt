This document is an index for the codes:

1) Project_Means is a script that averages the number of spikes correspoding to each neuron over all the trials of the experiment. This code is used for giving the PSTH plots in the report. 

2) Project_AdaBoost implements the Boosting Algorithm. The tunable parameters are: 
	a) The .mat file to be loaded (Chooses the day) (line 18)
	b) The width of the bin. This can be varied by changing the value of the variable bin_size (line 53)
	c) Number of trials to be used for testing and training. These are stored in numtrain and numtest (line 75-76)


3) Project_SVM implements the SVM Algorithm. The tunable parameters are: 
	a) The .mat file to be loaded (Chooses the day) (line 17)
	b) The width of the bin. This can be varied by changing the value of the variable bin_size (line 51)
	c) Number of trials to be used for testing and training. These are stored in numtrain and numtest (line 71-72)

Results: Final accuracy is given by: accuracy/(50*numtest)
